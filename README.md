# Gildardo Martinez's Portfolio

Welcome to my professional portfolio, showcasing my journey as a junior software engineer and USAF veteran transitioning from a Physics BS to full-stack development. This site highlights my ability to build scalable, user-focused applications using React, TypeScript, Node.js, and AWS.

Explore my projects and resume to see how I combine technical rigor from physics and teamwork from the Air Force to deliver innovative software solutions.
